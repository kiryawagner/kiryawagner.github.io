    "text": "Hello! My name is Kirya and I’m from Corona, California. I have always been active and involved in various sports growing up (like tennis and soccer), but I have recently been getting into pickleball!\nMy ideal free-time activity consists of anything outside, such as laying in the sun or doing something active with friends. I specifically love hiking and finding bodies of water to take a dip in. I also really enjoy camping, I usually go on road trips once or twice a year to get outside and enjoy nature a little. \nI have always loved cats, and I currently have three lovely kitties back home. They are so sweet and bring me a lot of joy. Recently, I have been introduced to the joys of songbirds! After working in wildlife rehabilitation at SBWCN and getting to learn about the vast species of birds in California, I have grown to appreciate them so much more. Therefore, my new future hobby is bird watching."
