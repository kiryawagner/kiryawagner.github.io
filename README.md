# My Personal Website 

Hello! This is a website I created in my ENVS 193DS data analysis class at UCSB. It features some background information about me, including my interests & hobbies, school & work experience, and some personal travel pictures.
This is my first time using GitHub and creating a webstie, so it was a bit of a rocky start, but I got the hang of it over time.
